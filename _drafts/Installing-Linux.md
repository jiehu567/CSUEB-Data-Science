## What is Linux and Why Do I Need It?

Linux is technically the kernel for the GNU/Linux operating system, but it has become the generic term for any operating system with it as its kernel (sorry if that was too CS-e). So Linux is an operating system, but unlike Windows from Microsoft or OS X from Apple, Linux is open source software. This means that the source code for the operating system is open for anyone to make it their own with any modifications they need. This makes Linux an operating system driven by the desires of the community, not so much by profit making features and astetics. 

So why should you install Linux if you already have Windows or Apple? 

Linux is an operating system that has been around for a very long time, and has matured with flow of the community. It has now become the operating system in the backend for many companies and servers around the world. But it has also become a very user friendly operating system. Most importantly, as I said before, Linux is an open source Operating System and this is the fundemental reason I believe everyone needs Linux. The fact that it is driven by commmunities allows it to be at the bleeding edge of technology. Many technologies are built around Linux and the open source framework such as Hadoop, R, Hive and many others. The knowledge and ability to work in a Linux enviroment will go a long way, and I strongly believe that in the near future it will be adopted almost entirely in some fields, including statistics.   

## Installing Linux 

### 1. Getting a Linux Distribution 

A Linux Distribution is an incarnation of Linux, they differ from each other not so much by performance but by functionality and its interaction with the user. You can check out all the distros at [Distro Watch](http://distrowatch.com/). For this tutorial we will using the Ubuntu Distribution for its ease of use and easy installation, for me this is the most important part. Once we have it installed since its open source we can change it anyway we want. If you would like to learn more about Ubuntu visit the [Ubuntu Website](http://ubuntu.com).

Let us now grab this operating system, our goal is to create a bootable USB (or other media) from which we can boot and install linux (yes its that easy). We can download  the ISO of the operating system here [http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). 

For the most part if your computer was made in the last 4 to 5 years then you can grab the 64-bit version of Ubuntu, otherwise if you have an old computer then 32-bit is the choice for you. 

### 2. Creating a Bootable USB Drive

Once the ISO download is complete we want to create a bootable USB from which we can install Ubuntu. Here we have a couple cases:

#### **You are Running Windows.**

If you are running Windows, once your download is complete you want to next download [Universal USB Installer](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/#button). You need a USB drive that is at least 8GB in size, insert it and right click the drive and format it to FAT-32 (all your data will be lost). Next locate the Universal USB installer download and open the application. 

* Choose from the dropdown list Ubuntu 

* Browse for the Ubuntu ISO on your system

* Choose the appropriate USB drive and click **Create**.

Once complete you have a bootable USB stick.
